HP-42s :  GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) by Euclid Division (GL version)

I have an HP-41C calculator since 1979, i guess, and it works...
But i wanted to continue RPN programming on smartphone or PC.
I found the excellent Free42 from Thomas Sokken : https://thomasokken.com/free42/ .
I decided to play with it!

I got inspiration from Edward Shore who created the original version here : https://edspi31415.blogspot.com/2016/07/hp-42s-programming-part-i-matrix-column.html .

I saw that i can optimize its code by removing 2 lines ... (yeah!).
I rewrote it!
